# alphabet
Write a script that prints every letter of the alphabet in lowercase on a new line.

For every 5th letter, print an uppercase letter instead.

For every vowel, print the vowel on the same line twice.

For letters which are both a vowel and a multiple of 5, print the vowel twice in uppercase.

Example:
```
aa
b
c
d
EE
f
g
h
ii
J
...
```
